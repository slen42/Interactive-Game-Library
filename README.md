# COMPSCI 235 Assignment phase 2 - Smoke¬ÆÔ∏è


## Description

This is the repository for an interactive game library application üéÆüéÆüìöüìö. 


## Installation

**Installation via requirements.txt**

**Windows**
```shell
$ cd <project directory>
$ py -3 -m venv venv
$ venv\Scripts\activate
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**MacOS**
```shell
$ cd <project directory>
$ python3 -m venv venv
$ source venv/bin/activate
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

When using PyCharm, set the virtual environment using 'File or PyCharm'->'Settings' and select your project from the left menu. Select 'Project Interpreter', click on the gearwheel button and select 'Add Interpreter'. Click the 'Existing environment' radio button to select the virtual environment. 

## Execution

**Running the application**

From the *project directory*, and within the activated virtual environment (see *venv\Scripts\activate* above):

````shell
$ flask run
```` 

## Development

To automatically reload app when changes have been made, run with the debug option set:
````shell
$ flask run --debug
````

## Testing

After you have configured pytest as the testing tool for PyCharm (File - Settings - Tools - Python Integrated Tools - Testing), you can then run tests from within PyCharm by right-clicking the tests folder and selecting "Run pytest in tests".

Alternatively, from a terminal in the root folder of the project, you can also call 'python -m pytest tests' to run all the tests. PyCharm also provides a built-in terminal, which uses the configured virtual environment. 

## Configuration

The *project directory/.env* file contains variable settings. They are set with appropriate values.

* `FLASK_APP`: Entry point of the application (should always be `wsgi.py`).
* `FLASK_ENV`: The environment in which to run the application (either `development` or `production`).
* `SECRET_KEY`: Secret key used to encrypt session data.
* `TESTING`: Set to False for running the application. Overridden and set to True automatically when testing the application.
* `WTF_CSRF_SECRET_KEY`: Secret key used by the WTForm library.
